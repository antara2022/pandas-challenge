# Pandas-Challenge
During this project, I analyzed the district-wide standardized test results for a city's school district. Using every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend, I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
# PyCitySchools
This folder contains PyCitySchools.ipynb, my Jupyter notebook. This file is the main script that was run for analysis. This folder also contains a Resources folder that contains the CSV files that were used. Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, I created a report that includes the following data: a district summary, a school summary, the highest-performing schools, the lowest-performing schools, math scores by grade, reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size and scores by school type.
